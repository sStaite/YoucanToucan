##YoucanToucan

YoucanToucan is a JavaScript game built using Phaser, based around the user trying to outwit the computer by guessing either 1 or 0, trying to avoid what the computer guesses. There are levels of difficulty, where the code utilises both Markov Chains and a LSTM.

This is a project that is helping me get into JavaScript, CSS and Html, as well as node.js and a bit of game dev (pixel art, etc). Also, I get to work my way through some ML topics that I want to know more about. 


To play: 

```console
git clone https://github.com/sStaite/YoucanToucan
cd YoucanToucan
npm install
npm run start
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:8000
